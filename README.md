Objective: Program an Arduino board to blink an LED at a specific interval.


Components:

Arduino Uno board

LED light

Breadboard

Jumper wires

Power supply

Software:

Arduino IDE (version 1.8.x or later)

Concepts:

Digital output

Timing and delay

Embedded programming

Hardware interfacing

Procedure:

Connect the LED to digital pin 13 of the Arduino board.

Write a program to turn the LED ON and OFF at a specific interval (e.g., 1 second).


Use the delay() function to create the timing interval.


Upload the program to the Arduino board.


Observe the LED blinking at the specified interval.


Expected Output:


The LED blinks ON and OFF at a 1-second interval.


Variations:


Change the blinking interval by modifying the delay() value.


Add more LEDs and create a pattern or sequence.


Use a button or sensor to control the LED blinking.


This project introduces basic embedded programming concepts, such as digital output, timing, and hardware interfacing, using the Arduino platform.
